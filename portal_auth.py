"""
Shared-passphrase gate, usable for one page or for the whole portal.

WHY A SHARED PASSPHRASE AND NOT REAL ACCOUNTS. Streamlit Community Cloud's
viewer allowlist needs every viewer invited by email and signed in. That is the
stronger control, but it does not fit a list that includes clients. The trade is
explicit: one secret everyone shares, no per-person revocation, and it WILL get
forwarded. Rotating it is the only revocation there is.

IT FAILS CLOSED. With no passphrase configured nobody gets in, and the page says
why rather than silently pretending to be a login. A gate that turns itself off
when misconfigured is not a gate. So whatever you gate, set its secret FIRST:
wiring a gate whose secret is missing takes that page down until it is added,
and per CLAUDE.md a fix means a manual reboot rather than a push.

TWO WAYS TO USE IT:

  # one page -- call at the very top of the page script, before anything renders
  portal_auth.require_passphrase("REPORTS_PASSPHRASE", title="Weekly Cattle Reports")

  # the whole portal -- call in Home.py immediately after set_page_config, and
  # ABOVE st.navigation. Streamlit runs Home.py on every request including a
  # deep link straight to /beef-cutout, then dispatches; below st.navigation,
  # or inside a page, every deep link would be open.
  portal_auth.require_passphrase()

Each secret name gets its own session key, so a page gate and a portal gate are
independent and unlocking one does not unlock the other.

THESE ARE NOT CHAT_PASSPHRASE. That gates the Ask AI tab to cap Anthropic spend.
Give every gate a different value -- reusing one that is handed to clients would
hand out the API budget with it.

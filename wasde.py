"""
USDA WASDE -- U.S. Meats Supply and Use, parsed from the released report.

Written for the Beef Trade page, but DELIBERATELY GENERIC: nothing here knows
about beef in particular, or about trade in particular. `load()` returns every
commodity and every attribute in the table, so a second page wanting the WASDE
production or per-capita line can import this module rather than growing a
second WASDE reader. That is the `snowflake_db.py`-times-five lesson applied
before the fact rather than after it.

    import wasde
    w = wasde.load()
    w.value("Beef", "imports")        # current forecast, million lb
    w.revision("Beef", "imports")     # change from last month's WASDE

WHY THE .txt AND NOT THE .xml. ESMIS publishes each release four ways and the
XML is the structured one, which makes it the obvious choice and the wrong one
here: it is 2 MB against the text file's 24 KB, and the revision panel wants a
dozen releases. Twenty-five releases of XML is 50 MB for two numbers apiece.

A fixed-layout text parse normally argues the other way -- it is the fragile
thing nobody notices breaking. Two things make it safe here:

  * EVERY ROW CARRIES ITS OWN AUDIT. Beginning stocks + production + imports
    must equal total supply, and total supply less exports and ending stocks
    must equal total disappearance. A shifted column is the failure that does
    not raise and does not look wrong -- a plausible number in the wrong place.
    `_row_ok` refuses a row that fails either identity, so a layout change
    shows up as a missing figure rather than a silently wrong one.
  * THE XML IS THE TEST ORACLE. tests/test_wasde.py parses the XML
    independently and asserts this parser agrees with it figure for figure.
    The structured file still does the work it is good at; it just does it in
    CI instead of on every page load.

THE RELEASE ALREADY CONTAINS LAST MONTH'S FORECAST. Each projection year prints
two rows, the previous month's estimate and this one -- "Aug" then "Sep". So
the month-over-month revision costs no extra request and needs no stored
history, which is why the headline panel is free and only the longer revision
chart has to go and fetch.

WHAT ESMIS DOES NOT HAVE. /release/findByPubId/1659 returns 25 releases, which
as of 2026-10-07 is August 2024 forward. **October 2025 is absent** -- that
WASDE was not published -- so a revision series has a real hole in it and
`history()` returns the gap rather than bridging it. A straight line across a
month USDA never published would read as a forecast that did not move.

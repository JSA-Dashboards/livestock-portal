Every number the Tuesday letter prints, fetched from the same source the
matching dashboard uses.

WHY THE REPORT IDS ARE REPEATED HERE. The dashboards are Streamlit scripts:
apps/cash_trade/app.py and friends call st.markdown() at module scope, so
importing them to borrow a fetcher would execute a page. The constants below
are therefore copied, not imported -- and tests/test_letter_drift.py reads the
app files and asserts every one of them still agrees, so a dashboard changing
report IDs breaks the test instead of silently sending stale numbers to clients.

The two modules that ARE import-safe get imported rather than copied:
apps/livestock_seasonal/massive_api.py (no streamlit) and
apps/cme_feeder_cattle/snowflake_db.py (loaded under a private name -- see
_load_fci_db for why that matters).

    # Friday had settled 335.00 -- and gather() returned no errors at all,

    # of staleness is invisible to every check that only asks whether data came
    # back. Nothing below trusts recency again.
    # THE TRIGGER IS TIGHTER THAN THE ALARM, deliberately, and they are not the
    # same question. Being wrong about whether to TRY the hourly bars costs one
    # request per contract. Being wrong about whether to shout "do not send"
    # costs the alarm its meaning, and a warning nobody believes is the state
    # this whole failure began in. So recovery starts the moment the series is
    # behind the last weekday it could have had a bar for, while settle_stale
    # below keeps the looser MAX_SETTLE_AGE_DAYS tolerance.

    # The trigger fires needlessly on the nine or so exchange holidays a year,
    # when the last weekday has no bar because nothing traded. That is harmless:
    # the hourly bars have no bar for a holiday either, so nothing is filled and
    # nothing changes. A day-count tolerance loose enough to cover those
    # holidays is also loose enough to hide a feed that is one session behind,

    chart in 2026: cattle is running 26-27% over the five-year average, the two

    Completed-week cattle slaughter and carcass weights from AMS SJ_LS712.

    WHAT THIS REPORT IS, AND IS NOT. SJ_LS712 is "Estimated Weekly Meat
    Production Under Federal Inspection" -- published Friday, covering the week
    ending the SATURDAY AFTER IT, which is the day after publication.

    THAT SENTENCE READ "the week ending the previous Saturday" until
    2026-09-29, and it is the reason the headline was never questioned. The
    report dated Friday 2026-09-25 carries week_ending 2026-09-26: Saturday
    entirely and most of Friday are PROJECTED, not counted. So this is not a
    completed week at all, and the function's own name overstates it.

    It gives that week, the week before, the same week a year ago, and
    year-to-date, which is exactly the "529,000 compared to 505,000 head LW and
    559,000 LY" line and both YTD percentages -- and those three head counts are
    not the same KIND of number. USDA labels the rows in the file itself:

        this week   Estimate   -- two days of it projected
        last week   Estimate   -- revised once since
        year ago    Actual

    render.friday_rundown_block therefore prints the week ending date and an
    "est." on that line. The Cattle Weights dashboard has always labelled its
    tiles "Live (Est.) - Wk Ending Sep 26, 2026"; the letter now agrees with it.

    It contains NO DAILY FIGURES AT ALL -- the letter's "Daily slaughter" and
    "WTD slaughter" bullets come from AMS report 3208 instead (fetch_daily_
    slaughter), and its "Average Weights" table is NOT the carcass weight the
    letter prints either (fetch_carcass_weights, AMS 3658). What is used from
    here is the completed-week head count and the two YTD percentages.

    Recent weeks are USDA ESTIMATES; only the year-ago row is actual. The report
    says so itself and the estimate is revised the following week -- which is
    why the weights here are reference only.

    week_ending is carried through so the letter can say which week it means.
    It is the report's own figure, not report_date + 1: relying on the offset
    is how the docstring above came to be wrong for months.

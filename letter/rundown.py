"""
The Cattle Market Rundown slide.

One client-facing slide of the day's fundamentals, in the shape Ross has been
typing by hand into PowerPoint: cash trade, carcass weights, cutout, grading,
the feeder index, and the two year-to-date rates.

IT NEVER FETCHES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.

`rows()` takes the ctx `build.gather()` has already assembled and formats it.
It has no import path to `sources`, no `requests`, and no database handle --
the same rule `render.py` follows, and a test asserts it. The reason is not
tidiness. CLAUDE.md records twice that the letter and a dashboard quoted the
same figure and disagreed, each defensible in isolation and neither raising,
and both took a morning to find. A slide built from a SECOND set of fetches
would be a third number in that argument. Built from the ctx, the slide and
the letter are the same arithmetic by construction and cannot drift.

MISSING FIGURES ARE MARKED, NEVER DROPPED.

A bullet that silently disappears reads as "nothing to report there", which on
a client slide is a statement -- and a wrong one. Anything a source did not
return prints `[[?]]`, exactly as the letter does, so a hole looks like a hole.
`missing()` counts them so the page can refuse to hand over a deck that is
quietly full of them.

THE FIGURES THIS FIXES, recorded because they were wrong on the hand-typed
slide for 2026-10-05 and the whole point of automating it is that they stop
being wrong:

    carcass weights   "as of 8/19/26" for a week ending 9/19/26 -- a typo in
                      the month, invisible because a four-week-old weight
                      looks no different from a two-week-old one. The week
                      ending is now printed from the data.
    Slaughter YTD     -7.7% against USDA's published -7.5%
    Beef Prod YTD     -5.3% against USDA's published -5.2%
                      Both are read straight off USDA's own Change rows, so
                      they are not our arithmetic -- the hand-typed pair had
                      been carried over from the previous week's slide.
    Feeder Index      337.79 against 337.22. NOT a firming-up of the same
                      row -- 337.79 is the 2026-09-25 value, carried forward
                      from the previous week's deck. fci_daily has 10/05 at
                      337.218 and 09/25 at 337.794. The row DOES firm up
                      separately (10/05 read 337.66 then 337.22 during
                      2026-10-06), and conflating the two is the mistake
                      this entry exists to stop repeating.

The 5-day average is the five sessions BEFORE the one being reported. See
`sources.fetch_cutout`, which carried the other convention until 2026-10-06.

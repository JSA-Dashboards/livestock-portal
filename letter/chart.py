"""
The chart of the day, drawn as inline SVG.

WHY SVG AND NOT A PLOTTING LIBRARY. plotly is installed and kaleido is pinned to
0.2.1, and that pair cannot export an image on Ross's desktop: plotly 7 requires
kaleido>=1, and requirements.txt pins 0.2.1 with a note that newer combinations
"silently break Cloud PNG export" for the dashboards. The letter is built on the
desktop, so the one machine that matters is the one where the export is broken,
and un-pinning kaleido to fix the letter would risk six dashboards.

Inline SVG has none of that: no dependency, nothing to install, the same output
on the desktop and the deployed app, and it stays sharp in the PDF at any zoom
because it is vector rather than a rasterised PNG.

NOTHING HERE FETCHES. It is handed a series and returns markup, the same
division render.py keeps -- the data comes from build.gather, which already
holds a Massive client, and a test asserts the renderer cannot reach a fetcher.

WHERE IT GOES, AND THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPED IT. Bottom right of the morning
brief, beside the signature block. That page was measured before any of this was
written: 8.28in of content in a 9.2in printable area, but the band to the right
of the signature is 1.89in tall and 4.97in wide and completely empty. A chart
that floats into THAT costs no vertical space at all, which is the only way this
could be added without spending the one-page budget CLAUDE.md calls the product.
Hence the size below. Make it taller than the band and the letter runs to two
pages -- there is a test.

         corn. The human already said what the morning is about; nothing
         computed beats that.
      2. What the day's headlines are about -- the candidate list the panel
         already fetched, weighted by source so USDA's own cash-trade narrative
         outranks a general newsroom that covered cattle once. This is what
         aims the chart before a word has been typed.
      3. What actually moved. Nothing in the text either way, so the most
         applicable chart is the market that did something -- scored as a
         percentage so 8 cents of corn and 40 S&P points compare.
      4. A rotation. Nothing to go on at all: a cycle that shows every chart once
         before repeating, shuffled per cycle so it is not a fixed weekly rota.

    NOTHING HERE FETCHES ANYTHING, and tier 2 must never cause a fetch: the
    candidate list costs several HTTP calls and is only passed in when the caller
    already has it. A CLI build that never asked for headlines simply skips to
    tier 3, which is why the reason string always names the tier that fired.

    DETERMINISTIC, NEVER RANDOM AT RENDER TIME. A letter is built twice -- once

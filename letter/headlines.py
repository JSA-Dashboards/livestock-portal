Candidate headlines for the morning brief's Headlines section.

NOTHING HERE REACHES THE LETTER. These are suggestions shown beside the
Headlines box on the authoring page, for Ross to pick from and rewrite. Every
other figure in the brief is a USDA or CME number that is either right or
marked [[?]]; a headline is editorial, and there is no [[?]] for "a feed
surfaced something misleading and it went out over JSA's name". So the split is
deliberate: fetched here, written by hand there.

It also keeps the copyright question simple. Facts are not copyrightable and can
be restated freely; someone else's headline text is theirs. Showing a title on a
private, passphrase-gated page as a pointer to go read the story is a different
act from reprinting it in a PDF sent to paying clients.

Three kinds of source:

  RSS        Beef Magazine responds to an ordinary request. Drovers and AgWeb
             both return 403 to anything that is not a browser, Meatingplace is
             subscriber-only, and Reuters' agriculture feed is dead -- so the
             list is deliberately short rather than padded with feeds that fail
             silently.

  USDA prose The narratives already fetched for the numbers. AMS writes a
             paragraph on every daily cash report describing how the trade went,
             and the border reports carry USDA's own commentary. Authoritative,
             free, cattle-specific, and no third party's copy.

  Packers    A Google News search for the four beef packers and for plant
             disruption generally, over RSS. ADDED 2026-09-23 BECAUSE OF A MISS:
             an ICE operation in Kansas had meatpacking plants delaying shifts,
             it ran on KMUW and across the Kansas public stations, and this
             panel never saw it.

             The lesson is about the SHAPE of the source, not the length of the
             feed list. What stops a plant for a shift gets reported where the
             plant is -- a local newsroom -- and no fixed list of trade feeds
             subscribed to those newsrooms or ever will. Only a query finds a
             story like that.

             Being a query is also its weakness, and it is a different weakness
             from the rest of this module: a feed either answers or it 404s,
             while a search that returns nothing looks exactly like a quiet news
             day. Read it as recall, never as coverage.

The parts of the letter that stay Ross's: Market Action, the technical read and
the Fundamental Rundown.

These live in a plain markdown file per issue, one "## " heading per section,
bullets as "- ". The builder writes the file with the headings already in place
and the computed figures quoted underneath as HTML comments, so the numbers you
are writing about are in front of you while you write, and re-running the build
picks up whatever you saved without re-fetching anything.

An HTML comment is used for the hints on purpose: they are visible while editing
and cannot reach the rendered letter even if left in place.

"""
"On this day" candidates for the letter, as a pick list.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. Nothing here writes itself into a letter. These are
candidates on the authoring page, exactly like the headlines, and for exactly
the same reason: a fact is EDITORIAL, and the rule this generator is built on
is that no fetched editorial text reaches a client under JSA's name without a
human choosing it. Every other figure in the letter is a USDA or CME number
that is either right or marked [[?]]; a fun fact cannot be marked.

WHY A HUMAN IS THE SAFETY, AND NOT THE FILTER. The first version of this
filter offered the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting as an AGRICULTURE fact --
"Route 91 Harvest festival" matched the farming pattern, and the grim filter
missed it because every stem in it was written \\bmurder\\b, which does not
match "murdered". Khashoggi, Mogadishu and the Amish school shooting came
through the same hole.

Two lessons are baked in below. Stems match as PREFIXES. And a candidate must
earn its place POSITIVELY -- sport, agriculture, or a US first -- rather than
being admitted unless something looks wrong. A denylist over an encyclopaedia
fails open, and failing open here means handing Ross a massacre to pick from.
Even so, the filter will let something tasteless through eventually. That
costs a glance, because he picks. It would cost a letter if it did not.

THE FACTS ARE NOT THE PROSE. history.com's blurbs are copyrighted editorial
writing; the underlying events are facts and are not. So the panel shows the
headline and the year as a PROMPT, links out to the source, and the caption
says to write it in your own words -- the same instruction the headline panel
already carries.

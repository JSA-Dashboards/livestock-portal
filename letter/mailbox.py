"""
Beef market headlines read out of Ross's own inbox.

Four subscription digests: Meatingplace, eMeat, Global AgriTrends and
Sterling. Adding a fifth is one line in DIGESTS.

WHY THE MAILBOX AND NOT THE SITE. These are paid subscriptions. Fetching their
web pages with a script is the thing their terms are most likely to prohibit,
and it needs a stored password. The digest email does not: it was sent TO Ross
because he subscribed, it is sitting in his mailbox, and reading it is the same
act as opening it. No request ever reaches their servers.

NO PASSWORD PASSES THROUGH THIS CODE. MSAL's device-code flow prints a short
code, Ross signs in through a normal browser, and Graph returns a token that
lives in a local cache file. Same flow basis-tracker/email_client.py already
uses for the ADM and Mendota bid emails.

WHAT IT DOES WITH THEM. Nothing but offer them. The digests feed the candidate
panel on the authoring page, which is a pick list; the letter still prints only
what Ross typed. Reprinting a trade publication's headline text in a PDF sent to
paying clients is a different act from reading it, and this module deliberately
cannot do the second one.

# THREE WAYS TO FIND A DIGEST, in descending order of precision:
#
#   sender      exact From address. Cannot match anything else. Best.
#   sender_name From display name, matched with startswith, for publishers
#               whose address is not visible in the mail client. Prefix rather
#               than equals because these names vary: eMeat sends as both "The
#               EMEAT Daily Bulletin" and "The EMEAT Daily Bulletin - 3 Price
#               Alerts". Still body-free.
#   subject  Graph KQL "subject:..." -- searches the SUBJECT LINE ONLY, never
#            the body. Right when the address is unknown but the subject is
#            distinctive.
#   match    bare $search, which reads sender, subject AND body. A word like
#            "sterling" then also matches a client email about sterling silver,
#            and that message's text surfaces in the panel. Fallback only.

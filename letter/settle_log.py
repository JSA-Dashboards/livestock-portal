"""
Our own record of the front-month settles, written every time a letter is built.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The week-over-week change needs one number per contract: the
prior Friday's settle. That normally comes from Massive's /aggs history -- and
that history has had NO BARS AT ALL for 2026-09-14..09-18 for over a week. The
live /snapshot endpoint the Seasonal dashboard uses was fine throughout; only
the historical series has the hole. So the durable fix is not a different API,
it is to stop depending on someone else's history for a number we see every day
anyway.

Every build appends what it just fetched. After one Friday's letter is built,
the following Tuesday's weekly change comes out of this file and never touches
/aggs again.

NOT IN out/. That directory is scratch and gets cleared; losing this file would
silently take the weekly change with it. It lives beside the code, gitignored --
it is market data, not source.

Last write wins for a given (ticker, date), so a letter rebuilt after the close
corrects an intraday value recorded earlier the same day.

AND IT IS MIRRORED TO SNOWFLAKE, as of 2026-09-28. Gitignored beside the code
turned out to be no safer than out/: a Streamlit Cloud reboot rebuilds the
container from a fresh clone, so letter/data/ arrives empty and the deployed
app's log has always been empty. Every Friday there, the weekly change fell
back to Massive's gapped history and printed [[?]] -- the very dependency this
file exists to remove.

THE MERGE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it is why this does not simply reuse
draft_store.restore() the way the commentary and the week base do. Those are
one authored document with one writer at a time, so newest-wins is right. This
is an ACCUMULATING LOG WITH TWO WRITERS: the desktop and the container each
build letters and each record what they fetched. Newest-wins on the whole file
would mean whichever saved last threw away the other's days. So it rides
JSA.LETTER.DRAFTS as one row PER SETTLE DATE under KIND = "settlelog", and
sync() folds those rows oldest-first into a union. Nothing is discarded, and a
repeated (ticker, date) still resolves to the last write, unchanged.

A row is a complete {ticker: settle} for its date, but the fold is per ticker
rather than per row, so a build that recorded only one product cannot drop the
other's price for that day.

"""
How the Monday Print Forecast has actually been doing.

Replays the forecast at the SAME POINT IN THE WEEK it is standing at right
now, for each recent week, and compares it with the figure USDA went on to
print. Two columns, because the tab's two steps fail differently and a single
accuracy number would hide that: the 5-Area call and the national one are
scored separately.

THE FORECAST FUNCTIONS ARE PASSED IN RATHER THAN IMPORTED, and that is the
whole point of this module existing. A scorecard that reimplements the thing
it scores grades a copy: the copy drifts, the page keeps its own behaviour,
and the scorecard reports on code nobody runs. `apps/cash_trade/app.py` is a
Streamlit script and cannot be imported, so the page hands its own
forecast_5area and forecast_national in and this replays those exact objects.

WHY THE CHECKPOINT MATCHES THE LIVE ONE instead of always scoring Friday's
1:30 pm cut. Accuracy is overwhelmingly a function of how far into the week
you are standing -- measured over 52 Friday checkpoints, the busiest quarter
of weeks land within a median 3% while the quietest are a median 36% out. A
scorecard fixed on Friday would therefore flatter a Wednesday reading of the
page by a factor of ten. Scoring past weeks at the same weekday and cut makes
the number underneath the forecast describe the forecast above it.

RECONSTRUCTION IS HONEST HERE, which is not something to assume -- the sibling
FCI scorecard exists precisely because reconstructing ITS estimate flatters it,
the input table growing as late auctions land until a replayed call has seen
data the real one never did. Checked 2026-10-02 rather than argued by analogy:

  - LM_CT150 History, the figure this scores AGAINST, carried **0** rows
    flagged `is_correction` over twelve months. The target never moves.
  - The daily /Summary files this replays FROM carried 44 corrections in
    8,160 rows, 0.54%. Rare and discrete, not the systematic upward drift the
    FCI case has.

So a replayed call is the call we would have made, to within half a percent of
input rows. The remaining exposure is real but small, and the fix for it is to
freeze each call when it is made rather than to stop replaying -- see
`capture_snapshots` in the cme-feeder-cattle-index repo for that shape.

Every week is replayed STRICTLY OUT OF SAMPLE: the analogue pool, the maturity
baseline and the 5-Area-to-national gap are all cut to weeks that had already
printed. Letting any of them see the week being scored would be marking our own
homework with the answers in front of us.

    # accuracy reads 23% when the calls those weeks actually produced were a
    # median 1.4% out.
    #
    # Worse, it contradicts the tiles. On 2026-10-06 the tiles reported the
    # settled Sep 28 week — called 60,897 against USDA's 60,063, scored where
    # the call was really made — while the table underneath said 49,062 for
    # that same week, scored at a Monday that had not happened when we called
    # it. Same week, two "we called" figures, one screen.

    # **THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GUARD TESTED `not live["wtd"]`, AND THAT
    # CAUGHT ONLY A LITERAL ZERO.** On 2026-10-07 the live week stood at 337
    # head — 0.75% of a typical week, which is nothing — so the guard sat out
    # and the whole failure came back: the table showed Sep 28 at 45,784 /
    # 66,340 against the 60,897 / 81,453 we actually called, and the headline
    # accuracy read 23.8% / 29.4% against 1.4% / 7.9% at the real checkpoint.

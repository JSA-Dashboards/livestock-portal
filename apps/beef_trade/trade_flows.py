US beef & veal trade -- monthly actuals, from USDA ERS.

    https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-and-meat-international-trade-data

Exports and imports, by partner country, monthly back to 1989, on a CARCASS
WEIGHT basis in 1,000 pounds. One CSV, no API key, no new host.

WHY THIS SOURCE AND NOT THE OBVIOUS TWO.

  * FAS ESR is what JSA's own Export Sales dashboard already reads, and it is
    excellent for what it is -- weekly, by destination, with outstanding sales
    -- but it is EXPORTS ONLY, it reports sales rather than customs-cleared
    trade, and it is product weight in metric tons. None of that can be
    compared with a WASDE forecast.
  * Census (the API the Mexican Feeder Imports ingest uses) is the underlying
    customs data, but it is product weight by HS code. Turning 0201/0202/0206
    into a carcass-weight equivalent means applying conversion factors, which
    is exactly the modelling step ERS has already done and publishes.

AND THE REASON THAT MATTERS: ERS IS THE SERIES WASDE FORECASTS, EXACTLY.
For 2025 this file's world totals are Exports 2,579.1 and Imports 5,388.0
million lb; the September 2026 WASDE prints 2,579 and 5,388. Verified on
2026-10-07 and pinned by tests/test_beef_trade.py. That identity is the only
reason an actual-versus-forecast panel on this page means anything -- it is
not a plausible comparison of two similar numbers, it is the same number.
**If it ever stops holding, the comparison is invalid**, not merely noisy, and
`basis_agrees()` exists so the page can say so instead of drawing it anyway.

"WORLD TOTAL" IS A ROW IN THE FILE, NOT SOMETHING TO DERIVE. Summing every
GEOGRAPHY_DESC double-counts the total by exactly 100%, which produces a
monthly export figure around 390 million lb against a true 195 -- a number
that is wrong by a factor of two and still looks like a perfectly reasonable
beef trade figure. The countries sum to the published total with ZERO error
across all 452 month/flow pairs, so `reconciles()` checks the identity rather
than trusting either side, and every helper here filters the row explicitly.

THE SERIES IS RESTATED. The file is republished whole each month and Census
revises, so a month already on this page can move. Nothing here caches it
longer than the page does, and the page prints the latest month it actually
received rather than inferring one from the calendar.

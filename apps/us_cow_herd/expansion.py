Did the herd actually expand, and did these signals call it?

Three signals the page already carries, set against the one thing that is not
a signal at all -- USDA's January 1 beef cow count:

    retention incentive      PRICE    what keeping her paid
    heifer share of receipts VOLUME   what producers did at the sale barn
    heifers on feed          VOLUME   where the heifers actually went
    beef cow inventory       COUNT    what the herd did, per NASS

THE VERDICT FOR A YEAR IS NEXT JANUARY'S COUNT, not this one's. Decisions made
during 2015 show up in the January 1 2016 inventory, so a signal read in 2015
is scored against the change from Jan-2015 to Jan-2016. Scoring it against the
change INTO 2015 would be asking whether the signal remembers the past, which
it does slightly better (r=+0.79) and which is worth nothing.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED, and it is less than the first cut of this
suggested. The retention incentive moves with the herd's change at r=+0.87
over 18 years, which needs no threshold and is the honest headline.

A DIVIDING LINE EXISTS BUT IT IS SOFT. Fitting a single cut to these 18 years
gets 17 of them right at 1.068 -- and that is an IN-SAMPLE number with one free
parameter chosen on the same data it is scored against. Leave-one-out, refitting
the cut without each year and then predicting it, gives **15/18** against a null
of 13/18 for simply saying "contract" every year. The refitted cut ranges 1.064
to 1.102 across those 18 refits. So the page draws a BAND, not a line, and says
15/18 rather than 17/18. Two years of edge over always-guessing-down is real and
is not a rule to trade off alone.

The other two signals have cuts of the same kind -- heifers on feed near 35.9%,
heifer receipts near 40.8% -- and combining all three scores no better than
retention by itself, so there is no ensemble here worth the name. They are
shown because their DISAGREEMENT is where the interest is: the three split in
5 of 19 years -- 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2026 -- and four of those sit at
the start, inside or at the end of the single expansion on record. That is
suggestive and it is not a rule: 2017 is squarely mid-expansion, and 2018 and
2019 split the same way and went opposite directions.

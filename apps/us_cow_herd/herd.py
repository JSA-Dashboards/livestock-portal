"""
US cow herd analytics: is the breeding herd expanding or liquidating?

Read-only, and deliberately free of `requests` so the dashboard can import it
without dragging the ingest's HTTP stack into a Streamlit process. Ingest lives
in replacement_reports.py; everything here reads what that stored.

WHY A PRICE RATIO IS THE HEADLINE. The definitive herd numbers -- beef cows and
beef replacement heifers -- are NASS January 1 inventory, annual. For ten months
of the year any rebuilding view runs on proxies, so the proxy had better be a
good one. A bred female is worth either what a neighbour will pay for her bred
or what the packer will pay for her by the pound, and the ratio between those
two IS the retention decision, priced weekly by the people making it.

    year   bred $/hd  salvage $/hd  ratio
    2020         889           661   1.37
    2021         909           731   1.25
    2022       1,021           842   1.21
    2023       1,329         1,100   1.22
    2024       1,770         1,470   1.21
    2025       2,388         1,778   1.32
    2026       2,874         2,028   1.44

READ THE RATIO, NOT THE PREMIUM. Both sides roughly tripled over this span, so
the dollar premium ($233 to $848) mostly tracks the price level. The ratio
controls for that and still rose from 1.21 to 1.44.

AND CHECK WHICH SIDE MOVED. The ratio rises either because bred values rise or
because salvage falls, and those mean opposite things. 2020's 1.37 came from
depressed salvage ($661, lowest in the series) -- packers stopped paying, not
producers wanting cows. 2026's 1.44 has both sides up with bred up faster,
+20% against +14%. Hence decompose() below, which reports the split rather than
leaving a reader to assume.

# after all, through a per-section endpoint the repo had not used; see
# feeder_sex_mix.ingest_mars_channels and direct_reports.py's docstring. Every
# channel now runs to the present.
#
# IT IS NOT A COSMETIC WIDENING. The auction-vs-all-channel gap is not a
# constant offset -- it was 4.57 points in 2015 and is 2.25 now, because the
# direct channel's heifer share climbed about twelve points over that span while
# auction's moved half a point. Since this page's headline is the DISTANCE
# between today and the 2015 rebuild, that drift lands squarely on it: auction
# alone says +0.64 points, all three say +2.96. Same direction, materially
# different message, and the wider measure is the more national one.

# Which archive OWNS a week, per channel. Legacy holds weeks up to and including
# the entry; MARS holds everything after.
#
# One rule per channel because the handovers happened at different times AND
# overlap differently: auction's two sources share 26 weeks, video's share 19,
# and direct's abut exactly with none. Summing an overlapping week double-counts
# it; preferring whichever source has more rows lets a dying remnant win at
# precisely the moment the remnant is largest. An absolute boundary does neither.
CHANNEL_LEGACY_THROUGH = {
    "auction": (2019, 17),   # MARS auction completes its panel at W19
    "direct": (2020, 38),    # MARS direct detail begins 2020-09-21 = W39
    "video": (2020, 19),     # see below -- NOT 18
}

# VIDEO'S BOUNDARY IS 19, NOT 18, AND THAT IS A CORRECTION.
#
# MARS video's first week is 2020-05-04 = ISO 2020W19, so handing that week to
# MARS looked right. It is not: in that week legacy carries 28,687 head and MARS
# only 1,967, because MARS is starting up rather than legacy finishing. The old
# boundary dropped 26,720 head. Nothing published moved -- 2020 is in SKIP_YEARS
# and the rolling series starts after direct's later handover -- but a rule that
# silently discards 93% of a week is wrong whether or not anyone is reading it.
#
# Safe in the other direction too: after that week legacy video never exceeds
# 6,408 head, so giving it W19 cannot let a remnant outvote a real MARS week.
#
# THERE IS NO VIDEO SEAM, and the "+1.62 points" this file used to cite as one
# was a measurement error of mine. It compared legacy 2019 with MARS 2021 -- two
# years apart, with 2020 skipped between them -- and called the difference a
# join. The adjacent-year join is legacy 2019 36.40% against MARS 2020 36.27%:
#
#     -0.13 pt.
#
# What the +1.62 measures is two years of market movement, and it is real:
#   * Within MARS alone, on a common week window, 2020 36.27% -> 2021 37.19% ->
#     2022 37.91%. A steady climb of about +0.9/yr with no archive change in it.
#   * It is WITHIN-location, not mix: decomposing legacy 2019 -> MARS 2021 gives
#     +1.62 within-location and -0.10 from the roster. Nine of eleven comparable
#     auctions rose, and the five carrying 92% of head all rose together --
#     Superior +1.61, Western +1.84, Cattle Country +1.57, Joplin +2.78,
#     Norwood +2.06. A coverage artefact moves a few locations; it does not move
#     every large one by the same amount.
#   * Norwood is the location where the two archives are PROVEN identical
#     (+0.22 pt over 12 paired weeks, see feeder_sex_mix.py) and it rose +2.06 --
#     more than the aggregate.
#   * Every artefact that could be quantified runs the OTHER way, hiding about
#     0.6 pt of real movement rather than manufacturing any: the unmatched
#     locations -0.07, legacy 2019's Northern hole -0.31 to -0.41, week-mix -0.21.
#
# The control channels were never controls, which is why this looked anomalous.
# Direct's tidy -0.12 across the same span is two large offsetting moves
# (44.09 -> 38.75 -> 43.97), not stability. And auction is the one channel
# holding both sources in the same year: 2019 legacy 46.28% vs 2019 MARS 45.84%,
# a cross-source difference of -0.44 pt. Small, and negative.

# 2020 has no honest annual point and is dropped rather than drawn.
# The basis is year-to-date through week 37, which in 2020 ends 09-13 -- but
# MARS direct does not start until week 39, so 2020 direct is legacy-only, and
# legacy direct by then is a decaying remnant: 53,949 head in the week of 08-03
# falling under 9,000 by 09-14. The point would print as a dip that is purely
# the source handover.

    """[{year, steers, heifers, weeks, complete, era}] -- whole years, all weeks.

    THREE THINGS DIFFER FROM heifer_share_annual, all of them because this is a
    LEVEL and that one is a RATIO.

    1. The whole year, not year-to-date through week 37. The short window exists
       so the current, partial year stays comparable; for a head count it just
       amputates the autumn run, which is when a third of the year's cattle sell.
       The current year is reported here as incomplete instead.

    2. A week missing a channel is KEPT. The share series drops it, correctly:
       the channels sit ~10 points apart, so two of three is a different mix.
       Volume has no such problem and the rule actively harms it -- video
       auctions are EPISODIC, a silent video week means no sale rather than an
       absent report, and skipping it would discard the auction and direct head
       that really did sell that week.

    3. No year is excluded for thin STATE coverage, but they ARE flagged, and
       the distinction cost a shipped error. A head count from twelve states is
       not a biased number the way a share is -- it is simply a smaller true
       one -- so excluding those years would be wrong. But drawing them on one
       continuous line is also wrong, because a line asserts comparability
       along its length: the auction panel fills from 12 states in 2000 to 18
       by 2005, and the 24% "rise" from 2001 to 2005 is mostly that. `thin`
       marks them so a caller can draw them apart, the way the share chart
       already does.

    2020 is still dropped. Legacy direct decays before MARS starts at week 39, so
    2020 direct lands at 74% of 2019 and 82% of 2021 -- a handover artefact that
    would read as a collapse in country trade.

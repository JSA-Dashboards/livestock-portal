"""
Mexican Feeder Imports -- how much Mexican cattle is reaching US feedyards.

Mexico normally supplies about 1.25 million feeder cattle a year, roughly 4% of
the US calf crop and concentrated in the southern Plains. New World Screwworm
suspensions cut that to 214,394 head in 2025 and to zero for the first seven
months of 2026. Douglas, AZ reopened on 24 August 2026 -- one crossing of five.

THE PAGE IS BUILT AROUND A LAG. AMS publishes daily head counts by crossing
point, current to yesterday, plus exact weekly totals with its own year-to-date
a week behind that. Census is the official customs count with seven years of
history but runs about six weeks late. So AMS answers "what is crossing now"
and Census answers "how does that compare to a normal year". In September 2026
a Census-only page would have shown zero imports for the whole year and said
nothing about the border reopening three weeks earlier.

A CORRECTION WORTH KEEPING. The first version of this page asserted that AMS
published no numbers at all and showed crossing DAYS as a proxy for volume.
That was wrong. MARS reports are split into SECTIONS addressed as PATH segments
(/reports/3486/Report%20Volume); requesting a report without one returns just
its header -- narrative and dates, nothing numeric -- which looks exactly like
a report with no data. The section list was in the response's `reportSections`
key all along.

DIRECTION MATTERS. AMS's status report covers both directions, and its standing
September 2026 note is about EXPORTS to Mexico being suspended while imports
were flowing. The import verdict here is computed from import-side crossing
activity only; the export note is shown separately and labelled. See
border.note_segments().

Analytics live in border.py, which is import-safe (no requests). Ingest is
border_reports.py and census_imports.py in the cme-feeder-cattle-index repo.

**Source.** Tamaulipas auction results from `mexicoganadero.com`, recorded by
`scripts/mx_auction.py` into `JSA.CME_FEEDER_CATTLE.MX_AUCTION_PRICES`. The US
side is USDA AMS report 3486 -- the same `border_prices` table the Crossings
tab quotes. Exchange rates are the ECB daily reference rate via
frankfurter.app, banked per sale date in `JSA.CME_FEEDER_CATTLE.FX_USDMXN`.

**The conversion.** MXN/kg to USD/cwt is kilos to pounds, pesos to dollars,
then per-pound to per-hundredweight. A missing rate leaves the cell empty
rather than defaulting, so no calf is ever priced at an implied 1.0 peso.

**Weight is matched on the midpoint.** The two ladders do not align --
Tamaulipas bands in kg, AMS in lb -- so each Mexican band is assigned to the
AMS bracket containing its own midpoint in pounds. Two Mexican bands can land
in one AMS bracket and are kept as separate rows rather than averaged: with no
head counts an average would weight a thin band equally with a heavy one and
print a figure no lot ever traded at.

**Sex is matched too.** BECERRO is a bull calf and pairs with AMS *Steers*;
BECERRA is a heifer calf and pairs with *Spayed Heifers*. Pairing across sexes
would read as a discount that is really a sex difference.

**Why Mexico has no feeder index.** Probed and recorded so it is not
re-derived: SNIIM (`economia-sniim.gob.mx`) is a slaughter-market system -- its
cattle series prices animals delivered to a rastro, and its calf series is
effectively dead. SIAP carries prices by municipality for Chihuahua and Sonora,
but annually, on a carcass basis, with 2025 published in August 2026. Neither
can answer what a feeder calf is worth this week.

**AMS (USDA Market News), current to {fmt_date(F['ams_through'])}**

- Report 3486, *Mexico to United States Feeder Cattle Import Summary* —
  section **Report Volume** gives daily receipts by crossing point
  (`receipts_current_est`, rounded to the nearest hundred head) and the
  week-to-date running total; section **Report Header** gives the narrative log.
- Report 3629, *U.S. – Mexico Livestock Imports/Exports* — section **Report
  Volume** gives exact weekly volumes with AMS's own year-to-date and
  prior-year-to-date; **Report Header** gives the weekly status note.
- MARS sections are **path** segments (`/reports/3486/Report%20Volume`). Passing
  `section` as a query parameter is accepted and silently ignored, returning the
  header — which is how this source was first mistaken for having no data.
- Daily figures are AMS **estimates**; weekly and YTD figures are **actuals**.
  Through 2026-09-04 the daily estimates summed to ~2,600 against an actual
  2,557 — a 1.7% rounding gap.
- Head counts use AMS's own "All Crossing Points / All Crossing States" row.
  The per-crossing rows are hierarchical rollups that triple-count if summed,
  and they disagreed with the published total on 19 of 463 days measured.
- Crossing days exclude days AMS published but reported no cattle crossing. AMS
  only began publishing those in 2026, so the raw report count understates the
  closure.

**Census (International Trade API), current to {fmt_month(F['census_through'])}**

- Live bovine animals, HS 0102, from Mexico (country code 2010), monthly,
  general imports, at the ten-digit commodity level.
- Quantity is Census's `UNIT_QY1`, checked on ingest to be “NO.” (number of
  head) rather than assumed.
- The HS10 code list is **discovered, not hardcoded** — the ten-digit breakouts
  get renumbered, and a code carrying all the volume one year can be empty the
  next. Entry types are classified at read time from the description, splitting
  off the “OTHER THAN PUREBRED BREEDING AND/OR DAIRY” exclusion clause first.
- Census publishes about six weeks after month end, so this series cannot
  answer what crossed last week. That is what the AMS status above is for.

**Not shown, and why**

- No price series **yet**. Report 3486's *Report Detail Current* section does
  carry structured prices, weight breaks, frame and muscle grade — it is simply
  not ingested here, and is the obvious next addition. Census value-per-head is
  a declared customs value that moves with both the market and the weight mix,
  so it is a level check rather than a quote.

"""
What a Mexican feeder calf is worth INSIDE Mexico, against the US border quote.

The page has always been able to price a calf the moment it reaches the US
side -- AMS 3486 gives $/cwt F.O.B. at Douglas and Santa Teresa, and the
Border Prices section differences that against the CME index. This is the
other half: the same animal before it crosses.

    JSA.CME_FEEDER_CATTLE.MX_AUCTION_PRICES   Tamaulipas auction, MXN/kg
    JSA.CME_FEEDER_CATTLE.FX_USDMXN           ECB reference rate, per sale day
    JSA.CME_FEEDER_CATTLE.BORDER_PRICES       AMS 3486, $/cwt F.O.B.

`scripts/mx_auction.py` writes the first two from the droplet. This module only
reads.

**IT DOES NOT IMPORT `requests`, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** CLAUDE.md records the
rule for this page: `border.py` has no HTTP path so the Streamlit process cannot
acquire one, and the ingest lives elsewhere. The conversion below is therefore a
second copy of `mx_auction.usd_per_cwt` rather than an import of it --
`mx_auction` needs `requests` for the scrape. `tests/test_mx_prices.py` runs the
two against each other over a grid so the copy cannot drift; that test may
import the scraper because a test is not the page.

THE COMPARISON IS HONEST ONLY IF THE READER IS TOLD WHAT IT IS NOT, and the
panel says all three out loud:

* **TAMAULIPAS IS NOT WHERE THESE CATTLE COME FROM.** Douglas and Santa Teresa
  take Sonora and Chihuahua cattle. Neither state has an auction on
  mexicoganadero.com, and the only figures for them anywhere are association
  spokesmen quoted in the Mexican press. Tamaulipas is a northern border state
  publishing real feeder bands by weight, which makes it the closest honest
  comparator and not the right one. A reader who takes the gap below as "the
  export premium at Douglas" has been misled by a number that is correctly
  computed.
* **THE TWO SIDES ARE RARELY QUOTED THE SAME DAY.** Tamaulipas sells roughly
  weekly; AMS quotes only on days enough head sell to establish a trend. So
  `compare()` pairs each sale with the NEAREST priced border date and returns
  `gap_days` for the panel to print. Pretending to a same-day spread would be
  the letter-vs-dashboard failure recorded in CLAUDE.md, arriving by a new
  route.
* **IT IS A LEVEL, NOT A MARGIN.** Nothing here nets out freight, the test, the
  crossing fee, shrink or the buyer's margin. A calf worth 60% of the Douglas
  price is not 40% profit.

WEIGHT IS MATCHED ON THE MIDPOINT, which is the one judgement call in here. The
two ladders do not align -- Tamaulipas bands in kg (151-180, 181-200, ...) and
AMS in lb (400-500, 500-600, ...) -- so a band is assigned to the US bracket
containing its own midpoint in pounds. Two Mexican bands can therefore land in
one US bracket, and they are kept as separate rows rather than averaged: with no
head counts an average would weight a thin band equally with a heavy one and
report a single figure that no lot ever traded at.

ONLY THE `CN` LADDER IS COMPARED. The site also prints wide `CNH` lots
(100-180, 181-260, 251-330 kg) which overlap the narrow ones and run far
cheaper -- BECERRO CNH 251-330 at 58.33 MXN/kg against CN 251-280 at 81.89 on
the 2026-09-30 sale. Mixing the two ladders would double-count a weight and
drag every comparison down by a grade difference the US quote does not share.
`CNH_PREFIXES` names them; `bands()` returns them flagged so the data table can
still show them, and `compare()` leaves them out.

SEX IS MATCHED TOO. BECERRO is a bull calf and pairs with AMS `Steers`;
BECERRA is a heifer calf and pairs with `Spayed Heifers`. Pairing a Mexican
heifer against a US steer quote would read as a discount that is really a sex
difference.

    brackets; calling it a four-weight gives $415 and 55%, calling it a
    five-weight gives $385 and 60%. Same calf, same 229.68, and the answer came
    down to which edge of the band you looked at.

    Feeder prices slide with weight, so the quotes are points on a curve rather
    than labels on bins: $415 at 450 lb, $385 at 550, $345 at 650, $315 at 750.
    Reading the curve at the band's own weight gives every lot a price matched

    * **Linear between adjacent anchors.** Four points over 450-750 lb is not
      enough to fit a curve to, and a spline through four points would invent

    * **FLAT inside the end brackets, never extrapolated past them.** A 420 lb
      calf sits below the 450 anchor but inside the 400-500 bracket, and AMS
      genuinely quotes it at $415 -- so the flat segment is USDA's own number,
      not an assumption. Past the covered range it returns None: a 828 lb lot
      is outside anything AMS quoted, and running the slide on would price it
      by projecting a trend off the end of the data.

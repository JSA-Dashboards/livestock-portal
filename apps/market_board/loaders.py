"""
Every number on the board, fetched once, from the module that already owns it.

THE BOARD CALLS THE SAME FUNCTION THE PAGE IT SUMMARISES CALLS. That is the
whole architecture and everything else here serves it. There is no second
implementation of any figure, so there is nothing to drift -- the failure
CLAUDE.md records four times, where the letter and a dashboard quoted the same
number, disagreed, and both were defensible.

**IT NEVER CALLS `letter.build.gather()`.** That function looks like a pure
assembly and is not: `build.py:324` runs `settle_log.sync()`, which INSERTs
local-only entries into `JSA.LETTER.DRAFTS`. A dashboard calling it would write
to the letter's durable store on every page load, from every viewer's session.
The individual `letter.sources.fetch_*` functions are read-only and are what
this uses.

**EVERY CACHE KEY CARRIES `SCHEMA`, AND THAT IS NOT BELT AND BRACES.**
`st.cache_data` keys on the decorated function's own code and its arguments and
NEVER on the modules it calls. Adding a key to `leverage.load()` once changed
nothing on the Packer Leverage tab -- the tile read a dash and the whole
section vanished, silently -- because `fetch_leverage`'s one-line body had not
changed and the disk cache kept handing back a dict from before the key
existed. `SCHEMA` below is a TUPLE of this module's version and every upstream
module's, so an upstream reshape invalidates us too.

**NO `persist="disk"` ANYWHERE.** Streamlit ignores `ttl` when `persist` is
set, so a cache written that way never expires. That is not theoretical here:
it is exactly how `fetch_leverage` on the Cash Cattle Trade page froze, keyed
on a constant sentinel, until it was fixed on 2026-10-07.

**EVERY LOADER RETURNS A DICT AND RAISES NOTHING.** A failed fetch returns
`{"error": ...}` and the board renders that signal as MISSING with the reason.
A raise here would stop the Streamlit script and blank the page -- and a board
whose whole job is showing twenty numbers must not be taken down by one dead
feed.

# `leverage` and `corn_cost` each exist exactly once in the repo, so neither

#
# **THIS PAGE DOES WIDEN THE `snowflake_db` COLLISION, THROUGH corn_cost.**
# `leverage.py` imports neither `requests` nor `snowflake_db` and is genuinely
# free. `corn_cost.py:45` does `import snowflake_db as db` by BARE NAME, so
# importing it here makes this page a sixth binder of a name that already
# exists five times -- and Python caches by name, so whichever page loads first
# wins and every other page gets ITS copy.
#
# All five copies are byte-identical today (checked: one distinct hash across
# apps/*/snowflake_db.py), which is the only reason this is a curiosity rather
# than a bug. It is also why the board must not be the thing that lets them
# drift: if a copy is ever edited, this page is one more reader that silently
# gets the wrong one. The alternative -- loading corn_cost by path under a
# private name, the way `letter/sources.py` and `am_cutout.py` load their db
# module -- does not help, because the bare import is inside corn_cost itself.

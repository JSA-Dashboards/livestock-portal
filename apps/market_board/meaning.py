"""
What each signal means, and the few things that can only be said across two.

THREE TIERS, SPLIT ON WHETHER A SENTENCE CAN BE WRONG WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING.

  1. The number and its as-of date. Arithmetic, or marked. No authoring.
  2. A committed sentence chosen by a rule from the signal's OWN direction.
     Written once, reviewed, in git, carrying `last_reviewed`.
  3. The cross-signal panels, which are the ONLY place a conclusion spanning
     two signals may be written.

**A TIER-2 TEMPLATE MAY NOT NAME A SIGNAL OUTSIDE ITS OWN `requires` SET**, and
a test asserts it against the rendered strings. This is not tidiness. An
earlier draft of this board had the cutout tile say "margin compressing on the
revenue side" -- a packer-margin call made from one leg -- six inches above a
cross-panel that refused to make that call because the cash print was eleven
days old. Both honestly computed; together, nonsense. That is the same shape as
the 2026-10-05 tiles-versus-scorecard failure CLAUDE.md records, and the fix is
structural: a sentence that needs two signals lives where both are in hand.

**STALENESS REPLACES THE CLAUSE; IT DOES NOT BADGE IT.** Past its window the
sentence is swapped for one naming the gap. A current-sounding reading under a
stale number is worse than no reading -- it is how the 2026-09-28 morning brief
printed 09-11 settles and read perfectly throughout.

**NOT AN LLM, WITH `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` SITTING RIGHT THERE.** Three grounds,
each already paid for here in another form. It is non-deterministic, so the
board and the letter would agree on a number and disagree in words -- the
letter-versus-dashboard failure in a medium where nobody diffs two sentences.
It produces a confident sentence with no MISSING discipline, so a stale figure
acquires an explanation instead of a mark. And it is fetched editorial text
writing itself into a surface, the line `letter/render.py` has an import test
asserting it does not cross. The defensible use is generating CANDIDATES for a
human to pick, which is what the letter's headline panel already does, and it
is out of scope here.

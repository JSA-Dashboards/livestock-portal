"""
CFTC Commitments of Traders -- Managed Money in the cattle futures.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS. Every Friday the CFTC publishes where the speculative funds
were positioned the previous Tuesday. For a cattle market the number that gets
quoted is MANAGED MONEY NET -- the funds' long contracts less their short
contracts -- in Live Cattle and in Feeder Cattle. That is the figure this
module returns and the figure the page leads with.

READ FROM SNOWFLAKE, NOT FROM CFTC. `JSA.CFTC_COT` is loaded by the droplet
job in JSA-Dashboards/cftc-cot-etl, Fridays at 3pm CT with a Monday catch-up,
and it re-pulls the last eight weeks each run so CFTC's own revisions land.
That buys three things the public API does not: history back to 2006 for the
disaggregated report and 1986 for the legacy one in a single query, no rate
limit on a page a dozen people may open at once, and the pre-1998 market codes
already joined and converted to contracts.

=============================================================================
THE LETTER ALREADY PRINTS THESE TWO NUMBERS, AND THE TWO MUST NEVER DISAGREE
=============================================================================

`letter/render.cftc_block()` renders "CFTC Report as of M/D/YY -- Managed Money
Traders (Futures Only)" on the Friday letter, with Net Long and WoW Change for
both cattle contracts. It is fed by `letter/sources.fetch_cftc()`, which hits
the LIVE CFTC Socrata dataset `publicreporting.cftc.gov/resource/72hh-3qpy`
rather than Snowflake.

So this page is the fourth JSA surface to quote a figure another surface
already publishes, and CLAUDE.md records three separate mornings lost to
exactly that -- two numbers, both defensible, neither raising. It was checked
BEFORE this module was written rather than after:

    120 rows compared (60 weeks x 2 markets, 2025-08-12 .. 2026-09-29)
    net mismatches 0 | long 0 | short 0 | week-over-week 0

To the contract, on every row. Which it has to be, because they are the same
CFTC publication arriving by two routes. What makes them agree is that this
module makes the same three choices `sources.fetch_cftc` makes, and each one
is load-bearing:

  * REPORT_TYPE = 'FUT'. Futures only, never futures-and-options COMBINED.
    `sources.py` records that the combined set gives Live Cattle 45,262 for
    the 9/18/26 letter where futures-only gives 47,696 -- both plausible
    cattle numbers, which is why a wrong choice there fails silently. Over
    the full 1,060 weeks the two bases differ by a mean 3,038 contracts in
    Live Cattle and run as far apart as 21,603.
  * The DISAGGREGATED report, never the legacy one. Legacy "Non-Commercial"
    is not Managed Money -- it also carries the other reportables, and for
    the 9/18/26 letter it flips Feeder Cattle to a NET SHORT of 3,853, which
    inverts the market read.
  * Net is LONG minus SHORT, with MM_SPREAD excluded. See SPREADING below.

If the two surfaces are ever seen to disagree, the cause is almost certainly
the release-window race described under `is_current()`, not the arithmetic.

=============================================================================
TWO FREE AUDITS, BOTH CHECKED ON EVERY LOAD
=============================================================================

A net, a share and a weekly change are all numbers between plausible bounds
whether or not they are right, so nothing here would fail loudly on its own.
Both identities below hold EXACTLY over the whole cattle history, so a
tolerance would only hide a fault:

  1. MM_NET = MM_LONG - MM_SHORT. Zero violations in 4,240 cattle rows across
     both report types.
  2. CFTC's own published change columns reproduce the week-over-week diff of
     the levels: MM_LONG_CHG equals the diff of MM_LONG across all 1,037
     adjacent-week pairs in both cattle markets, and the same for shorts.
     NOTE THAT THIS HOLDS ONLY ON 'FUT'. On 'COMBINED' the long leg alone fails
     on 198 feeder and 283 live weeks, and the NET change -- two rounded figures
     differenced, so the errors compound -- fails on 361 and 437. Every single
     one of those errors is one contract, or two on the net. One more reason the
     headline basis is futures-only.

The open-interest identity -- every category's longs plus the spread columns
summing to open interest -- is NOT exact: it runs up to 3 contracts out, on
both sides, which is CFTC's own residual in the non-reportable column. It is
therefore a tolerance check (`OI_TOLERANCE`) and a warning rather than a
refusal, because the headline figure does not depend on it balancing.

=============================================================================
THINGS THAT LOOK WRONG AND ARE NOT
=============================================================================

SPREADING IS EXCLUDED FROM NET, AND IT IS LARGE. Feeder Cattle on 2026-09-29:
17,364 long, 9,198 short, and 10,252 SPREAD -- a spread position being equal
and offsetting long and short legs held by the same trader, which CFTC counts
once in its own column rather than in both of the others. It nets to zero by
construction, so folding it into "net" would be adding zero contracts with a
label on them. It is still worth showing, because a market where the funds'
spread position is larger than their net tells a reader the directional bet is
smaller than the gross figures suggest.

THE NEWEST FIGURE IS ALWAYS AT LEAST THREE DAYS OLD, AND USUALLY MORE. The
positions are as of a TUESDAY and are not published until the FRIDAY. By the
following Thursday the newest available reading describes a market nine days
gone. A COT number read as a current position is the commonest way this report
is misused, so `as_of` is never inferred from the calendar -- it is read off
the same rows as the figures, the way `render.cftc_block` learned to after the
9/18/26 letter was headed with the wrong week's date.

THERE ARE NO MISSING WEEKS, BUT THERE ARE MONDAYS. Every step in the cattle
series is 6, 7 or 8 days: 1,037 of 1,059 are exactly 7, and the 22 others are
6/8 pairs around a federal holiday, where the Tuesday report date slips back
to the Monday. So a gap check must not demand 7 days, and `is_current()`
allows the newest report date to be one day early for that reason.

NET AS A COUNT OF CONTRACTS IS NOT COMPARABLE ACROSS TWENTY YEARS. Feeder
Cattle open interest has roughly doubled -- a 29,617 average over 2006-2010
against 59,722 over 2022-2026 -- so a 20,000 net in 2008 was a far bigger bet
on the same market than a 20,000 net now. `context()` therefore returns the
net as a share of open interest alongside the raw percentile, and the page
leads the long-history comparison with the share.

FEEDER CATTLE GOES NET SHORT AND LIVE CATTLE ESSENTIALLY DOES NOT. Managed
money has been net short feeders in 248 of 1,060 weeks (23.4%) and net short
live cattle in 15 (1.4%). Nothing here may assume the net is positive: the
sign is carried by a WORD -- "long" or "short" -- rather than by a leading
minus or, far worse, by parentheses, which in CFTC's and USDA's own reports
mean NEGATIVE. That is the trap `letter/sterling.py` and
`apps/beef_cutout/am_cutout.py` both document.

    same 4,103 because shorts covered is a market squeezing people out. Live

#     managed money net, futures and options combined    7,638 long
#     non-commercial net, the older Legacy report        2,081 SHORT
#

# one anywhere else -- most broker screens, chart services and press wires
# still quote legacy non-commercial as "the funds" or "large speculators" --
# will read this page as broken. CLAUDE.md records three mornings lost to two
# JSA surfaces quoting the same figure and disagreeing; this is the same
# failure with the OUTSIDE WORLD as the second surface, and it is live today
# rather than hypothetical.
#
# SO THE PAGE SHOWS ALL THREE AND EXPLAINS THE GAP WITH AN IDENTITY, which is
# the only honest way to do it, because the gap is not an estimate:
#
#     NONCOMM_NET = MM_NET + OTHER_NET        exactly, 1,060/1,060 weeks,
#                                             both cattle markets, max error 0
#
# The older report had one "non-commercial" bucket; the disaggregated report
# split it into managed money and "other reportables". Feeder cattle's other
# reportables are net short 10,247, which is the whole of the difference and
# the whole of the sign flip. That is a sentence a reader can check, and it is
# asserted on every load rather than written in a comment.
#
# LEGACY_IS_NOT_A_HISTORY. The same view reaches back to 1986 and it is
# tempting to chart it as "twenty more years of fund positioning". It must not
# be, for two independent reasons, either of which is fatal:
#
#   * The gap between the two is not a constant offset. It drifts and changes
#     sign -- the annual mean gap runs from -2,837 in 2019 to +10,805 in 2026
#     -- so a spliced line would show moves that are a reclassification rather
#     than a market.
#   * Before October 1992 the legacy report was SEMI-MONTHLY, not weekly: 24
#     reports a year through 1991, 31 in 1992, 52 from 1993. A chart "back to
#     1986" silently changes its own sampling rate mid-axis.
#
# (The feeder contract was also 44,000 lb rather than 50,000 before mid-1992,
# which kills any constant-multiplier conversion of that era as well.)

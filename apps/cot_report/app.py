"""
Commitment of Traders -- where the funds are positioned in the cattle futures.

THE PAGE EXISTS FOR TWO NUMBERS. Managed money net futures position in Live
Cattle, and in Feeder Cattle. They are the first thing on the page, they are
above the tabs, and they are above the outage guard. Everything else here is
context for them and is arranged so it cannot push them below the fold.

WHY IT IS WORTH A PAGE WHEN THE LETTER ALREADY PRINTS THE SAME TWO FIGURES.
The Friday letter's CFTC block gives the net and the week's change, which is
the right amount for a letter. What it cannot give is the thing that makes
either number mean anything: that 53,193 Live Cattle contracts is the 47th
percentile of twenty years and the 26th of the last five; that the funds have
been net long for 338 straight weeks; that the week's rise was short covering
rather than new buying; and that producers and merchants are net short 95,274
on the other side of it. See `cot_positions.py` for the proof that the two
surfaces quote the same figure to the contract.

THE HEADLINE BAND AND THE FRESHNESS LINE RENDER ABOVE THE OUTAGE GUARD, the
same four-line shape as the Saturday Slaughter view and the morning cutout
panel. There is only one source here, so an outage takes the whole page -- but
it must take it LOUDLY, naming the reason, rather than drawing an empty chart.

A NET IS A PLAUSIBLE NUMBER WHETHER OR NOT IT IS RIGHT. Nothing on this page
fails loudly on its own, which is why `cot_positions.reconciles()` runs on
every load and the audit line under the tiles says so out loud.

    """
    The whole page's data, in two queries.

    =====================================================================
    `epoch` IS WHAT MAKES THE PAGE PICK UP FRIDAY'S REPORT ON FRIDAY
    =====================================================================

    CFTC publishes at 2:30pm CT and the ETL loads Snowflake at 3pm, but a TTL
    knows about neither: it is a stopwatch started by whoever last opened the
    page. On an hour's TTL a reader could be served the previous Tuesday's
    positions until 4pm on a Friday the new report landed at 3 -- correctly
    computed, correctly dated, and a week old.

    `cot.data_epoch()` rolls over at 3pm Friday, so passing it here makes the
    cache expire ON THE EVENT rather than on a timer. The TTL stays as a
    backstop: if the ETL is late the epoch has already rolled, the refetch
    returns the old week, and half an hour later it tries again.

    `schema` is in the signature ONLY to key the cache. `st.cache_data` keys on
    the decorated function's own code and its arguments and never on the modules
    it calls, so without it a change to `cot_positions.load()` would leave this
    serving a dict from before the change and the tiles reading a key that is no
    longer there -- rendering an em dash with nothing raising. The identical trap
    is recorded against `leverage.SCHEMA` in CLAUDE.md.

    =====================================================================
    THE ARGUMENT HAS NO LEADING UNDERSCORE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
    =====================================================================

    Every other cached loader in this repo spells it `_schema`, and in that form
    IT DOES NOT KEY ANYTHING. Streamlit deliberately excludes any parameter whose
    name begins with an underscore from the cache key -- that is the documented
    mechanism for passing unhashable things like a database handle into a cached
    function -- so `_schema=mod.SCHEMA` is hashed exactly never and bumping the
    constant changes nothing at all.

    Measured rather than assumed, on the Streamlit in this venv:

        @st.cache_data
        def f(_schema=1, normal=0): ...
        f(); f(2); f(1); f(1, 9)   ->  the body ran for (1,0) and (1,9) only
                                       f(2) was served from the cache

        @st.cache_data
        def g(schema=1): ...
        g(); g(2); g(1); g(2)      ->  the body ran for 1, 2, 1

    So the guard works with the underscore removed and is inert with it in
    place. THE TRAP IT IS MEANT TO CATCH FIRED ON THIS VERY PAGE while it was
    being built, with `_schema` in the signature and the constant freshly
    bumped: `why()` gained an `agree` key, the hero tile read `.get("agree")`,
    the cached dict predated it, `.get` returned None, the tile printed the
    wrong sentence, and `persist="disk"` carried the stale dict across two full
    server restarts. Nothing raised at any point.

    `apps/beef_cutout`, `apps/beef_trade`, `apps/cash_trade`,
    `apps/mexican_feeder_imports` and `apps/market_board/loaders.py` all still
    use the underscore form -- sixteen loaders in all. They are not changed from
    here; that is its own job and its own review.

    FRAMES ARE RETURNED AS DATAFRAMES AND THAT IS FINE -- st.cache_data pickles
    what it stores and a DataFrame pickles cleanly. What must never go in here is
    a dataclass, which goes stale against its own class the moment its module is
    edited; `load()` returns plain dicts for exactly that reason.

    An hour, because CFTC publishes once a week. The TTL is there to pick up a
    revision landing in the ETL's eight-week re-pull, not to chase a live feed.

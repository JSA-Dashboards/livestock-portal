USDA AMS daily slaughter estimates -- the only place a SATURDAY kill exists.

Nothing else on this dashboard can answer a day-of-week question. The NASS tab
and the SJ_LS712 feed behind the AMS tab are both WEEKLY (week-ending Saturday)
totals, so a Saturday figure is not a slice of them -- it is a different report.
That report is AMS 3208, "Daily Livestock and Poultry Slaughter", published
every business day: PDF at `ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3208.pdf`, viewer at
`mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/viewReport/3208`.

No new secret. It reuses the MARS_API_KEY this page already holds for report
3658.

THE SLUG IS SECTIONED, which is the trap the cme-feeder-cattle-index repo's
`direct_reports.py` documents at length for the direct/video slugs:

    GET /reports/3208                           -> HTTP 200, narrative rows,
                                                   NO head counts at all
    GET /reports/3208/Report Livestock Commodity -> per-day head, all species
    GET /reports/3208/Report Livestock Class     -> Steers/Heifers vs Cows/Bulls

The bare call does not fail. It answers 200 with plausible-looking rows that
simply have no `slaughter` key, which reads exactly like a report that has
stopped publishing. The section name is a PATH SEGMENT, not a query param --
`?section=...` is accepted and ignored.

Three things about the data that will produce a wrong number if assumed:

- **HISTORY STARTS 2024-01-01.** One unfiltered call returns the whole series
  (~6,900 commodity rows) and that is all MARS keeps. Any question about 2023
  or earlier is unanswerable here, so `FIRST_YEAR` is surfaced on the page
  rather than left for a reader to infer from an axis.

- **One slaughter_date appears in several reports.** Friday's report carries
  Friday as `period="Current"` AND Saturday as a PROJECTION, then Monday's
  report restates Saturday as `period="Previous"`. Dedupe by taking the row
  with the latest `report_date`; `_latest_by_day` does this.

- **Saturdays revise UP far more often than down.** 14 of the first 145
  Saturdays on file were ever revised, and the moves are not small: 2024-11-30
  went 39,000 -> 47,000 and 2024-07-06 went 42,000 -> 47,000. So today's
  Saturday number is a forecast and tomorrow's comparison is against settled
  history -- `is_projection` marks it and the page says so.

WHY A BIG SATURDAY IS USUALLY NOT NEWS, which is the whole reason this module
computes week context instead of just plotting a series. Every Saturday at or
above 38,000 head between 2024-01-01 and 2026-10-02 fell in a week that had
lost a weekday to a holiday -- New Year's, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving. The 2026-09-12 Saturday of 70,000, the largest on file, sat in a
Labor Day week whose Monday killed 2,000; the week still totalled only 505,000
against a 2026 median full week of 527,500, so the sixth day recovered most of
the lost Monday and not all of it. A Saturday number quoted without its week is
therefore close to meaningless, and `saturday_frame` never returns one.

`week_to_date` is the report's own running total and is the free audit: Mon-Sat
summed must equal the Saturday row's WTD. `reconcile()` checks it so a silent
dedupe mistake shows up as a number rather than a plausible chart.

Vendored nowhere -- like `cold_storage` and `cof_recap`, this name exists once
in the repo, so the by-name `sys.modules` collision the portal lives with (see
CLAUDE.md on `snowflake_db.py`) does not apply here.

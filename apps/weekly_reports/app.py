"""
JSA Daily Cattle Reports — build the client letter from live data.

The authoring surface for the daily letter. Everything it does is a thin
shell over the letter/ package, which is also driven from the command line by
`python -m letter.build`; the two share the data cache and the commentary file
in out/, so a letter started here can be finished there and the other way round.

PASSWORD. This page is gated on its own REPORTS_PASSPHRASE and the rest of the
portal is not. That is deliberate: the dashboards show published USDA data, but a
draft here is Ross's unsent market read, hours before clients pay to receive it.
See portal_auth.py -- the gate fails closed, so set the secret before deploying.

WHAT THIS PAGE CANNOT DO WHEN DEPLOYED. Streamlit Community Cloud runs Linux
containers with no browser, so letter.topdf finds nothing to drive and the
one-click PDF is unavailable there -- the page offers the HTML instead and you
print it with Ctrl+P, which uses the same print CSS and gives the same result.

DRAFTS SURVIVE A REBOOT NOW, and that is new as of 2026-09-25. The container
filesystem is still ephemeral, so out/ is still destroyed every reboot; what
changed is that the draft no longer lives only there. Every edit is autosaved
to JSA.LETTER.DRAFTS as well, append-only, and pulled back on the next load.
This docstring used to end "a draft written on the deployed app does not
survive a reboot" -- it said so accurately, and a nearly finished Friday letter
was lost to exactly that anyway, because a warning in a docstring is not a
backup. See letter/draft_store.py.

THE PRIOR-FRIDAY SETTLES GO WITH THEM, as of 2026-09-26. They are the only
other thing on this page typed in by hand, they lived in the same doomed out/,
and they cost the same six numbers off last week's letter to re-enter. Same
table, KIND = "weekbase", keyed by the Friday rather than by the letter.

    // -- so it rounded to 2112 and HALF THE IMAGE WAS EMPTY WHITE. It goes
    // into a HubSpot email at that size, trailing band and all.

    // The watermark is the same bug wearing a different hat. `.wm` is
    // position:fixed at top:46%, and html2canvas lays fixed elements out
    // against the windowHeight it is given -- so 46% of 2112 put the
    // 50-years mark down by the signature instead of centred on the page.
    // Capturing at the real height centres it by construction, with no
    // special case for it anywhere. Reported together by Ross, and they

    Put the button INSIDE the letter's document, not in front of it.

    THE OBVIOUS VERSION IS `_print_ui + html` AND IT BREAKS THE DOCUMENT.
    `render.build_html` returns a complete page beginning `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
    Concatenating anything ahead of that doctype means the doctype is no longer
    first, so the parser DISCARDS it and the whole letter renders in QUIRKS
    MODE. Measured 2026-09-30 on the real preview, in a real browser:

        document.compatMode   "BackCompat"   (standards: "CSS1Compat")
        document.doctype      null
        <meta>, <title> and the letter's ENTIRE stylesheet -> inside <body>
        first cash band       102px tall, against 108px in standards mode

    Quirks mode changes table row heights and margin collapsing, so the letter
    the reader prints from this preview was NOT laying out the same as the one
    `Build PDF` produces -- two print paths that are supposed to be identical,
    silently diverging in the one direction nobody checks. Nothing raised, and
    the page count happened to stay at one, which is why it survived.

    So: the style goes in <head> and the button just inside <body>, leaving the
    doctype where the parser needs it. Both halves fall back to prepending if
    the letter ever stops having a head or a body -- a preview with the button

USDA Cold Storage — end-of-month stocks, the full published history.

Data comes from QuickStats, NOT from the monthly PDF at
`esmis.nal.usda.gov/.../cost{MM}{YY}.pdf`. The PDF is one month with two
comparison columns; QuickStats carries the same numbers back to **1917** for
beef, pork, lamb, turkey and cheese, and to 1915 for butter, which is what
makes a real MoM/YoY history possible at all. Same API and same NASS_API_KEY
the rest of this dashboard already uses, so the Cold Storage view needs no new
secret.

USDA REVISES THE PRIOR MONTH, AND QUICKSTATS CARRIES THE REVISION. Each
release rewrites the month it reports and the one before it — visible in
`load_time`, where both Jun and Jul 2026 carry 2026-08-24. The revisions are
not always small: total beef for 31 Jul 2026 was published at 382,714 thousand
lb in the August report and restated to 398,285 in the September one, +4.1%,
essentially all of it in boneless. That single restatement moves July's YoY
from -3.8% to +0.1% — it crosses zero. So a figure on this page can change
after the fact, and when it does that is USDA revising, not a fetch bug. It
also means a page built on one archived PDF would go on showing a number USDA
no longer publishes, which the live query cannot do.

Two NASS spellings that cost a query if guessed:

- `freq_desc` is **POINT IN TIME**, not MONTHLY. Filtering on MONTHLY returns
  nothing at all, with a 400 that reads "bad request - invalid query" and means
  "no rows" (see the usda-nass-etl CLAUDE.md on that status code).
- `reference_period_desc` is **"END OF AUG"**, so the month is the LAST token.
  `app._month_num` already reads it that way and is reused here.

The series are NATIONAL only. NASS publishes regional cold storage in the
report's back half, but not into QuickStats, so there is no state or region
breakout to offer and none is implied anywhere on the page.

Vendored nowhere. Unlike `snowflake_db.py` and friends this name exists once in
the repo, so the by-name `sys.modules` collision the portal lives with does not
apply — same footing as `cof_recap`.

# not publish into QuickStats. It is beef + pork + veal + lamb & mutton, which

# 862,128 thousand lb against USDA's printed total of 862,128. The report has
# no fifth red-meat bucket for the sum to miss. Its history starts 1944, the
# year veal starts, rather than 1917.

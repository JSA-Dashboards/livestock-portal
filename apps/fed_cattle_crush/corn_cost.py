Delivered corn cost at the feedyard -- the input a cost-of-gain build-up needs.

THE DISTINCTION THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR. Almost every published corn price is an
elevator BID: what a farmer receives for delivering grain there. A feedyard pays
something else entirely -- a delivered price carrying the elevator's margin and
the freight to the bunk. Measured on the one region where AMS publishes both:

    Texas South Plains, 30-day average
        Livestock Feeding Operations (delivered)   $6.27/bu
        Country Elevators (bid)                    $5.41/bu
        spread                                     +$0.86/bu

At an 80% corn ration and 6.5:1 conversion that 86c is about $8/cwt of gain, or
$52 a head over 650 lb of gain. Feeding an elevator bid into a cost-of-gain
calculation understates corn by that much, silently.

TWO SOURCES FOR THE BID, CHOSEN BY DEPTH.

  JSA Basis Tracker   ~50 scrapers pulling facility-level bids straight from
  (JSA.BASIS_TRACKER)  ADM, Bunge, Cargill, CHS, Scoular and the rest. Hundreds
                       of quotes per state where it is strong. Stored as BASIS
                       in cents against a futures symbol, so a flat price is
                       futures + basis.

  USDA AMS             state grain-bid reports, regional averages. Thinner, but
  (corn_bids)          it covers the Southern Plains where JSA has almost
                       nothing -- Texas is one location, Wyoming none.

Compared over ten states on 2026-09-11 the two agreed to within a dime wherever
JSA had depth (Iowa 1c apart on 654 quotes against 49), which is about as good
a cross-check as two independent collection methods can give. They diverged
only where JSA was thin. So: JSA where it is deep, AMS elsewhere, and the page
says which it used.

THE DELIVERY ADDER IS AN ASSUMPTION, and is surfaced as its own field rather
than buried in the corn price. Texas is the only empirical anchor at +86c, and
that is a grain-deficit region where corn ships a long way. The Corn Belt
defaults are lower because the crop grows next to the yard -- but they are
estimates, and a feeder who knows their own delivered basis should overwrite
them.
